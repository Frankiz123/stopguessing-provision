I dealt with horrendous acne as a teen and not-as-bad-but-still-an-issue-acne as an adult. I also have terribly oily skin, plus I live in Hawaii where I sweat all the time which makes the oil worse, which makes the acne worse! It's an awful cycle.
    A model whom I follow on social media recommend Stop Guessing products she uses for her oily skin. And I knew she had oily skin cause you could see it on TV. So I decided to give this brand a shot!
    I'm SO glad I did! I can't say that I'm oil and acne free, but the oil my face produces is way less and the zits are significantly smaller the next morning after I use the mask.
    I would highly recommend this brand, especially for those with oily skin! And the fact that it's organic is a huge bonus! You know you're not putting a bunch of gross chemicals on your face.`,

I just received the package and decided to try this out immediately. I was a little worried because I've never used a microdermabrasion product before and my skin is so sensitive... I can't even use salicylic acid products or depilatories without suffering puffy rashes afterwards.
    So, I put this on my face, and by the time I went to scrub, I could feel the moisturizer really working on my skin. I was also concerned about the size of the scrubbing granules, but what first seemed too harsh, after the moisturizer set in my skin it started to feel amazing, and I began to really enjoy the scrubbing feeling after all.
    Even as I was rinsing it off, I realized what a great job this product did for me. The pesky blackheads all over my nose were completely gone, after a ton of other products have left at least some of them behind. I actually have seriously clean pores right now!
    My face feels SO smooth, and even just moving the muscles in my face I can feel the sensation of suppleness in my skin! It almost seems like I must have been neglecting my face before, but that isn't so. Anyway, I can't wait to try out the regular facewash now.`,
